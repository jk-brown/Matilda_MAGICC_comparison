## Figure Descriptions

-- `unfiltered_hector_ensemble_summarized.png` --
Full Hector ensemble showing result of parameter uncertainty without any scoring or filtering.
Each panel is a different scenario, solid line is medaian `global_tas`, gold ribbon = 33-67% CI; grey ribbon = 10-90% CI.
Results normalized to 1850-1900 reference period.
This data uses results from expanded ECS uncertainty.

-- `BAU_unfiltered_hector_ensemble_summarized_with_magicc_cmip6` --
Full Hector ensemble showing parameter uncertainty without anyt scoring or filtering for the BAU scenario against CMIP6 and MAGICC7.
Solid line black is the median `global_tas` variable for the full Hector ensemble for the BAU scenario, gold ribbon = 33-67% CI; grey ribbon = 10-90% CI.
Solid red line is the median warming projection for the BAU scenario from Ou and Iyer et al.; dashed red ribbon = 90-10% CI for MAGICC, estimated from MAGICC online resource.
Light grey lines are the CMIP6 ESMs.

-- `BAU_unfiltered_hector_ensemble_spaghetti_with_hist_temp` --
Spaghetti plot of full HEctor ensemble showing individual ensmeble members without any scoring or filtering for the BAU scenario against observed temperature (GMST).
Solid grey lines are individual Hector ensemble members (total 5000) as a result of parameter uncertainty in the BAU scenario. 
Solid red line is the median warming projection for the full Hector ensemble; red ribbons = 33-67% CI, 10-90% CI, and 5-95% CI respectively. 
Solid blue line is historical temperature (GMST); blue ribbon = one standard deviation. 

-- `scored_filtered_hector_ensemble_summarized` --
Full Hector ensemble showing result of parameter uncertainty with filtering. Figure shows summarized results from the top 2500 ensemble members.
Each panel is a different scenario, solid black line is median `global_tas`, gold ribbon = 33-67% CI; grey ribbon = 10-90% CI.
The red line represents the median warming projection using data from Ou and Iyer et al. 2021.
Results normalized to 1850-1900 reference period.

-- `filtered_and_unfiltered_hector_comparison_with_magicc.png` --
Figure shows summarized results for MAGICC, filtered Hector ensemble (top 2500 performing members), and unfiltered Hector ensemble.
Solid red line show median MAGICC warming projection from Ou and Iyer et al. 2021; red ribbon/dashed lines = 10-90% CI for MAGICC, estimated from MAGICC online resource. 
Solid yellow line shows median Hector warming projection from full (unfiltered) Hector ensemble; yellow ribbon/dashed lines = 10-90% CI.
Solid blues line shows median Hector warming projection from scored and filtered (top 50% - 2500 members) Hector ensemble; blue ribbon/dashed lines = 10-90% CI.
